#Project: SQL

##Description
This project will demonstrate that you know how to set up a mySQL database and access each of the CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) actions using a Java program.

This project will allow you to demonstrate your expertise using the following SQL keywords:
+ CREATE TABLE - Create an new, empty table.
+ INSERT a new record of data into a table.
+ SELECT a specific set of data from a table.
+ UPDATE any record in a table.
+ DELETE a record from a table.
+ DROP (delete) a table.

##Specifications
For this project you will be building a database to contain a collection of inventory items as part of an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system.

1. Visualize - Design the database schema holding the data. It should include at the minimum:
+ A unique key field that is auto-incrementing.
+ Description
+ Part number
+ Quantity
+ Original cost of item
+ Selling price

This should be done using Excel to give your presentation a professional look and feel.

2. Write a Java program that will allow all four CRUD operations.
+ Connect to a database.
+ Run SQL statements that do not return any data.
+ Run SQL statements that return a ResultSet with data.
+ Release any DBF resources such as ResultSets, Statements, or Connections
+ Create a new table (based on your Excel schema specifications)
+ Insert records into the table
+ Display all the data in the table for any given category (Extract this from the part number. The last two letters designate a category)
+ Update a record in the database with new data
+ Delete a record from the database

3. Use GIT to maintain a version control of your code.
