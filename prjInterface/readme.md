#Project: Interface

##Description
This project will demonstrate the following:
+ I can design a basic interface in Java that will be used to create other classes.
+ I can design several classes that implement the interface.
+ I know how to override the toString() method from the Object class.
+ I can demonstrate using overriding with other methods.
+ I can create a professional UML class diagram using my code and add-on tools.

##Code requirements

###Interface
Write a parts interface that can be used to create new classes used by the inventory program
+ It will include at least one static property
+ It will include at least three methods.

###Classes
Write two classes that implement the parts interface.
+ Include at least three private properties
+ Include at least one protected property
+ Include at least two constructor methods (One will be the default.) You can have more constructors 
if you think it will make your class more useful.
+ Include setters and getters for the properties you want exposed for other classes to use.
+ Include at least one method tha tis unique to each class.

###Children
Write a child class that inherits from one of the three classes
+ Include one method that overrides the method that is unique to it's parent class.
+ Use the @override compiler tag.
+ Directly access the protected variable from the parent class using the correct keyword.

###Test
Write a test program that creates objects from each of the three classes and stores them in a data structure, such as an ArrayList. Demonstrate polymorphism by looping through the data structure and displaying information unique to each class.
+ Write a simple method that displays a short simile for each of the following showing your understanding of the term.
+ Call the method so the results display in the console after all the other output.
+ Please keep your instructor interested by thinking of your own similes and not using the ones he beat to death in class.

###UML
+ Include a UML diagram
